# Kode
Kode is a dynamic programming language based on Java ... It provides the following features over some of the other programming languages listed below -

- Numbers are limitless and has both Infinity and NaN ( undefined ) available such that dividing by zero can be also performed mathematically without throwing any error or exception.
- Numbers somewhat follows the IEEE754 like formats and rules for operations, and is constructed by the wrapper class Double from Java.
- Unlike complied languages like Java and C/C++, Kode is totally a tre-walk interpreter based language and can be used as an scripting language, though it slows down its execution speed.
- Variables do not have any datatype and works just like Python and JavaScript, and can be used to store functions and classes along with values in it.

## What's Planned to be added in future
- A quite unique Package Management System. [ Currently Working ]
- System functions will be added to manipulate files.

## How to Contribute
Anyone can contribute to this project in any means by keeping in mind, the Code Of Conduct attached with this project.<BR>
#### Fields where you can help me --
- Help me with the issues
- Can Generate new functions / Libraries for enhancing its productivity. ( One can also submit in algorithms/pseudo-code format )
- Debugging & Testing needed [ Important ]

## Note
As there is no documentation avialable till now, so you can read the PDF file attached in the root of the repository, to get an idea about this language.

Thanking You,<BR>
