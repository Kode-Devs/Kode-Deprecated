# Kode
Kode is a dynamic programming language based on Java ... It provides the following features over some of the other programming languages listed below -

- Numbers are limitless and has both Infinity and NaN ( undefined ) available such that dividing by zero can be also performed mathematically without throwing any error or exception.
- Numbers somewhat follows the IEEE754 like formats and rules for operations, and is constructed by the wrapper class Double from Java.
- Unlike complied languages like Java and C/C++, Kode is totally a tre-walk interpreter based language and can be used as an scripting language, though it slows down its execution speed.
- Variables do not have any datatype and works just like Python and JavaScript, and can be used to store functions and classes along with values in it.

## What's Planned to be added in future
- [Imp] A documentation about its syntax will be added.
- A try-catch like block will be added.
- System functions will be added to manipulate files.
